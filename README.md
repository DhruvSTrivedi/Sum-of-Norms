# Convex Clustering Using Sum-of-Norms Approach

## Overview

This document outlines the application of the sum-of-norms clustering method, which is a type of convex optimization problem in unsupervised machine learning. This method is particularly useful for discovering natural groupings within a dataset based on underlying patterns.

## Variables and Functions

### Variables:
- `U`: Cluster centroids for each data point in `X`.
- `F`: Auxiliary variables for the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to ensure the equality constraints.

### Objective Function:
- Data fidelity term: `0.5 * cp.sum_squares(U - X)`
- Regularization term: `gamma * cp.sum(cp.norm(F, axis=1))`

## Constraints and Optimization

### Constraints:
- Enforced by list comprehension: `'[F[i*n + j, :] == U[i, :] - U[j, :] for i in range(n) for j in range(n)]'`
- Ensures differences between centroids are accounted for.

### Optimization Problem:
- Defined as `problem = cp.Problem(cp.Minimize(objective), constraints)`
- Solved using the SCS solver.

## Application to Data

The following Python code snippet applies the sum-of-norms clustering to a smoking dataset:

```python
# Data Standardization and Clustering
clustering_data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(clustering_data)
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=num_clusters, random_state=0)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(clustering_data_scaled)

# Data Visualization
plt.scatter(clustering_data_scaled[:, 0], clustering_data_scaled[:, 1], c=clusters, cmap='viridis')
plt.colorbar(label='Cluster')
plt.show()

# Sum-of-Norms Clustering Function
def sum_of_norms_clustering(X, gamma):
    # ... function implementation ...

# Applying the function to the dataset
centroids_subset = sum_of_norms_clustering(X_std_subset, gamma)
```

## Visualization Post-Clustering

The clustered data can be visualized using dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA:

```python
# PCA for dimensionality reduction
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
reduced_data = pca.fit_transform(clustered_data[...])

# Cluster Visualization
plt.scatter(reduced_data[:, 0], reduced_data[:, 1], c=clusters, cmap='viridis')
plt.colorbar(label='Cluster ID')
plt.show()
```

Each point represents a data instance, and the color coding corresponds to the cluster assignment.

## Theoretical Background

The sum-of-norms clustering differs from K-means in several key aspects, including the objective function, cluster shapes and sizes, determination of the number of clusters, robustness to outliers, computation complexity, and interpretability.

## Conclusion

Sum-of-norms clustering provides a nuanced view of data structures, revealing complex patterns that simpler algorithms like K-means might not capture. This makes it a powerful tool for unsupervised learning in datasets with intricate groupings.
